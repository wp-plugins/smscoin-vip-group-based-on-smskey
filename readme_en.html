				<ul>
					<li> Works only on PHP 5 version.</li>
					<li> To use this module you first must register on http://smscoin.net website, 
					and connection to sms: key service.</li>

 					<li> Registration and connection process are absolutely free.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<h3>How it works:</h3>
				
				This plugin enables you to provide paid access to any content on your website. <br />
				In reply SMS user receives a short text password (key), <br />
				and following its activation, user moves to VIP group. You define the page  <br />
				on which user will pay for the transition to VIP group, indicate the following tag  <br />
[SMSCOINPAY]. You decide which articles you want close with the tags [rpayment]. <br />
			
				You can emulate the process of paid registration by estblishing the period time in VIP group  <br />
				(Vip Time) that equals to a large number, for example 99999 days. In this case, by paying for VIP status the user  <br />
				has the right to access the hidden content during the enture time of website existence   <br />
				At the end the time period in VIP group, the user  <br />
				receives an SMS message the text of which is determined by you. (Tip: In the letter itself you should attach the link <br />
				to the payment page).
				<br />
				<br />
				Example ( [SMSCOINPAY] tag):
				<br /> 
				<br />
				<img src = "pic/en/vip_page.png" border = "1"/>
				<br />		<br />		<br />
								Example (tag [rpayment] text [/ rpayment]):
				<br /> 
				<img src = "pic/en/vip_hide.png" border = "1"/>
				<br />
				<p> We advice you not to use the module several times on the same page. </p>
